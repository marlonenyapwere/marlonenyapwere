Hi there 👋 I’m <strong>Marlone Nyapwere</strong> — a Software Engineer with a strong interests Backend Development, Distributed Systems, and Cloud Computing.<br><br>

I’m particularly interested in how <em>software engineering meets systems</em>: scalability, performance, reliability, and real-world constraints.<br><br>

This space is my <strong>public learning notebook</strong> 📝 where I document:
<ul align="left">
  <li>Backend & systems concepts (Java, Spring)</li>
  <li>Cloud & distributed systems ideas</li>
  <li>Algorithms & CS fundamentals explained simply</li>
</ul>

I’m currently growing toward a strong <strong>backend / systems-oriented software engineer</strong>, learning in public and refining fundamentals along the way.<br><br>

Think of this as growth-in-public — honest, imperfect, and evolving 🚀
